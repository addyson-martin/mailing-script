1.  First of all we need to enable the 'mailing from less secure app ' on the sender's google account.

2. There is a file zoororisaman.py ... input your email and password in the fields provided in there.

3. (in mail.py )Make a list of names and emails in the variables recipent_name and recipent_mail .. You can also use pandas to create the df from large files.

4. Now if the setup is done correctly ... You need to run the mail.py file.

5. After the process is completed .. a response.txt will be created showing the mails which are sent successfully.

6. Even if there a unknown runtime err.. don't worry you can refer to successfully sent mails in the respoonse file.
