# mailing-script

This mailing script can be used a mass-mailer. 
We often require to send e-mails to a large number of people with some minor changes (eg. names etc.). This script will somehow help you to make that work easy.

To setup follow instructions.txt.

With some changes in mail.py you can use this in a multiple way.

For example:- 
1. It can help you for managing Public Relation at the time of your college fest ;) .
2. You can create a OTP sender app. (CLI support provided)
